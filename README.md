Simple CRUD system made with symfony.
You can add, delete, edit and view events in the database using the CRUD system.

To get it working on your local machine, you must:
-install symfony dependencies (https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html)
-install xampp or any similar software that simulates a database system in your local machine
-add the database from the .sql file included in the zip file to your database system
-run the server (on my machine, the command is "php bin/console server:run"
-open your browser and go to localhost:8000 (or the chosen port)
